    The following block will record the "tea" item in the list. The surrounding ul tag is needed to differentiate this item from the other span of class cuppa.
    <ul class = "my_list">
      <span class = "cuppa" record = "text as favorite"></span>
    </ul>

    To record the other span of class cuppa:

    <span class = "cuppa" record = "text as other_cuppa"></span>

    To record the first five items in the list:

    <ul class = "my_list">
      <for items = "items" condition = "i < 5">
        <li class ="my_item" record = "text as item_text">
        </li>
      </for>
    </ul>

    If dates are recorded, the condition in the for loop can be based on the date:

    <ul class = "list_with_dates">
      <for items = "items2" condition = "date < 2018/03/01">
        <li record = "text as item_text"><span class = "my_date" record = "date as date"></span>
        </li>
      </for>
    </ul>

    Code blocks can be conditionally recorded within if statements:

    <if condition = "favorite = Tea" >
      <p class ="test_if" record = "text as if_text"></p>
    </if>



    <div class = "my_list">
      <forchild items = "items_mixed" >
        <div class ="my_item" record = "text as item_text"></div>
        <p class ="milk_class" record = "text as item_text"></p>
        <str record = "text as item_text"></div>
      </forchild>
    </div>

    Follow recorded hyperlinks using the jump tag to scrape linked pages:

    <a record = "href as my_link">
      <jump on = "my_link">
        <ibody>
          <div class = "message" record = "text as msg"></div>
        </ibody>
      </jump>
    <a>
